Previously, the Google CoLab environment needs to have loaded both the tweet_documents_ids_map.csv, tw_hurricane_data.json and evaluation_gt.csv  files.
Prior to being asked to construct the queries for the second evaluation phase, you must first execute all the cells of the indexing part. The five queries "hurricane ian," "south carolina," "assist people," "flood damage," and "storm florida" must be written in the input box.
The evaluation phase follows, where we will assess each query's precision@K (P@K), recall@K (R@K), average precision@K (P@K), F1-score, mean average precision (MAP), mean reciprocal Rank (MRR), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).
We'll conduct two evaluations.
Evaluation 1: Which includes a baseline and three pre-defined queries ( Landfall in South Carolina, Help and recovery during the hurricane disaster,Floodings in South Carolina). Thus, in order to do this evaluation part, the  three queries  must be written in the input box.
Evaluation 2: All the cells will need to be executed as the queries have already been defined.
