In order to be able to execute the code, the following files must be uploaded into the Google Colab environment:  tw_hurricane_data.json, tweet_documents_ids_map.csv, and evaluation_gt.csv. Then, the cells must be executed following the pre-established order in the ipynb file. In the indexing part, before the evaluation phase, the system will ask you to write 5 queries, one at a time. The queries to write to the input box are the following: "hurricane ian," "south carolina," "help people," "flood damage," and "storm florida” in this order. You must write one query at a time, and press the enter button. Then the system will ask you to enter the next query. This procedure must be repeated  5 times. Right after, in the evaluation phase, you will be again asked to enter 3 more queries: “Landfall in South Carolina”, “Help and recovery during the hurricane disaster”, and “Floodings in South Carolina”. The same procedure must be followed for these 3 queries. After entering the last query the system will continue executing and no more actions will be needed.
